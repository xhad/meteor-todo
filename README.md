This is a simple app based on the Meteor Tutorial simple-todo app.

Use it to share a single coding todo list with your friends. The list updates on everyone's screen in real time, and you can make tasks private if you don't want others to see them.

Learn how to build this app by following the [Meteor Tutorial](http://www.meteor.com/install).
